# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

#BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition caused by diabetes that damages the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Analyzing it using image processing techniques in Python is vital for early detection and treatment. Python's capabilities allow for the automated analysis of retinal images, identifying signs of retinopathy, such as microaneurysms or hemorrhages. This early diagnosis enables timely intervention, preventing vision loss. Python's efficiency in handling large datasets and its accessibility make it a valuable tool in managing diabetic retinopathy on a large scale, improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
